### Ten Useful Ideas to Practice Scala Macros - generated by AI Assistant

1. **Custom Debug Logging**  
   Write a macro that automatically generates debug logging statements including the file name, line number, and
   variable values at runtime without the need for explicit log calls.

2. **Enhanced Case Class toString**  
   Build a macro that generates a more readable `toString` method for case classes, including optional formatting based
   on annotations.

3. **Automatic Resource Management**  
   Develop a macro that wraps any block of code in a `try-finally` structure to automatically handle resource cleanup,
   like closing files or database connections.

4. **Property Getter/Setter Generator**  
   Create a macro that generates getter and setter methods for regular classes automatically, similar to property
   accessors in other languages.

5. **Query Validation**  
   Design a macro that validates query strings used in SQL, Elasticsearch, or similar systems at compile time for
   correctness (e.g., ensuring proper syntax and parameter use).

6. **Custom Collection Builders**  
   Implement a macro that generates methods to simplify the creation of custom collections, such as immutable lists or
   maps, based on user-provided types.

7. **Compile-Time Arithmetic**  
   Create a macro to calculate constant expressions at compile time, throwing errors when non-constant or invalid
   expressions are used.

8. **Event Listener Registration**  
   Write a macro to simplify and automate event listener registration and unregistration to avoid boilerplate code for
   systems like GUIs or reactive streams.

9. **Data Class Diff Generator**  
   Build a macro that generates a function to compute differences between two instances of the same case class,
   returning a map of field names to their changed values.

10. **Static Code Analyzer**  
    Experiment with writing a macro to analyze your codebase for design issues, unused imports, or patterns that can be
    optimized, offering compile-time suggestions.

Each of these ideas provides a practical use case for Scala macros, diving deeper into metaprogramming while offering
immediate benefits to your workflow.
